 Find a peak element which is not smaller than its neighbours
Given an array arr of n elements that is first strictly increasing and then maybe strictly decreasing, find the maximum element in the array.

Note: If the array is increasing then just print the last element will be the maximum value.

Example:

Input: array[]= {5, 10, 20, 15}
Output: 20
Explanation: The element 20 has neighbors 10 and 15, both of them are less than 20. */




//6.                    positive_missing.java


// Smallest positive missing number .
//Accoute,Amazon,Samsung,Snapdeal

//You are given an array arr[] of N integres including 0. the task is to find the smallest
//positive number missing from the array.
//e.g : [0,-9,1,3,-4,5]
//Hence, the first positive missing number is 2.



// 7 . Implement Stack Operation in Java.


//8.
// Find union and intersection of 2 arrays.


//9.// WAP that will display the count of the most repeating string and the string too.


//10.// Write a program that will find the pair of the given sum in the ARAAY.


////11.    sml_ele_idx_repeat.java

// Given an array arr[] of size N. The task is to find the first repeating element in the array of integres. i.e an
//element that occurs more than once and whose index of the first occurence is smallest.
//	E.g : [1,5,3,4,3,5,6]
//	 output : 2               (FACEBOOK , AMAZON )




// 12. //WAP THAT WILL ACCEPT A SENTENCE AND PRINT THE LARGEST WORD FROM THAT SENTENCE/.

//13.  WAP that will create an array and also accept an element
   // and find whether it is present or not in the array, if present return the index value.


//14. // longest arithmetic subarray.
// e.g : [10,7,4,6,8,10,11]
//       sub-array :[2,4,6,8] 
//       output should be 4.
// exclude the condition for 0.(it means , if the difference between the number is 0 , then skip that).
